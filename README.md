# ftc-score
ftc-score is the product of a [research paper](https://github.com/Yey007/ftc-score/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf) I wrote on scoring FIRST Tech Challenge games using computer vision.
I used live streams from the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy season. The code was written with extensibility in mind, but is still tailored to Freight Frenzy.

If you want to know about the strengths and weaknesses of the program, check out the analysis section of the paper. 

In case there are future commits, it's important to note that the paper was based on code from [commit 3bb3013](https://github.com/Yey007/ftc-score/tree/3bb3013bfc7470b2b5b0cca7c989c30e72954272).
