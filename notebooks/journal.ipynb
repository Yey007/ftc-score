    "* Trying to implement normalization algorithm\n",
    "    * It's giving me all nan for some reason\n",
    "    * I think the numbers are too big? trying 64 bit floats\n",
    "    * I'm trying subsets of the array. The numbers top out at like 26000 before going Nan. Wtf? I know float64 goes *way* higher than that\n",
    "    * Ohhhh there are Nans in the array. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.\n",
    "    * Alright, it's working but it's still very slow. I'm not sure if it's working correctly as well.\n",
    "    * Well let's start by cropping the image...\n",
    "    * Ugh... I've been trying this for hours now. Fuck this, i'm gonna try something else\n",
    "    * Alright, I implemented a bunch of different stuff. I'm a little concerned because all of them are quite slow. I can't get beyond 15 FPS. Constant normalization may not be an option.\n",
    "* I tried a bunch to implement corner detection for the field\n",
    "    * Not going too well lol\n",
    "    * Tried 3 different methods, honestly rn the line based one is looking most promising but needs a lot of work\n",
    "    * For now I'm doing it manually so I can move on to more important stuff\n",
    "* Talked with professor she gave some ideas\n",
    "* We still don't know what's wrong with the comprehensive normalizer (if anything)\n",
    "* Working on field detection while reimplemented processor runs\n",
    "    * Hough lines is a mess, maybe it would work if I tuned it\n",
    "    * Line segment detector performed much better off the bat so i'm going to start tuning that\n",
    "    * It works really well! I might need to do some distortion correction for best results\n",
    "    * The one issue is that due to robots in the way I can really only detect the upper lines of the field. In order to get the really nice overhead view that can track robot positions I'm gonna need to do something else.\n",
    "    * I also made the line detector more robust. It now doesn't just give up and die if it doesn't see the field immediately\n",
    "    * LCN normalization isn't a good bet for detecting grey stuff. In some videos the field turns out more blue (especially in wisconsin videos)\n",
