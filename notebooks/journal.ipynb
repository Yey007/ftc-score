    "* Trying to implement normalization algorithm\n",
    "    * It's giving me all nan for some reason\n",
    "    * I think the numbers are too big? trying 64 bit floats\n",
    "    * I'm trying subsets of the array. The numbers top out at like 26000 before going Nan. Wtf? I know float64 goes *way* higher than that\n",
    "    * Ohhhh there are Nans in the array. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.\n",
    "    * Alright, it's working but it's still very slow. I'm not sure if it's working correctly as well.\n",
    "    * Well let's start by cropping the image...\n",
    "    * Ugh... I've been trying this for hours now. Fuck this, i'm gonna try something else\n",
    "    * Alright, I implemented a bunch of different stuff. I'm a little concerned because all of them are quite slow. I can't get beyond 15 FPS. Constant normalization may not be an option.\n",
    "* I tried a bunch to implement corner detection for the field\n",
    "    * Not going too well lol\n",
    "    * Tried 3 different methods, honestly rn the line based one is looking most promising but needs a lot of work\n",
    "    * For now I'm doing it manually so I can move on to more important stuff\n",
    "* Talked with professor she gave some ideas\n",
    "* We still don't know what's wrong with the comprehensive normalizer (if anything)\n",
    "* Working on field detection while reimplemented processor runs\n",
    "    * Hough lines is a mess, maybe it would work if I tuned it\n",
    "    * Line segment detector performed much better off the bat so i'm going to start tuning that"
